            Curious about me? Here you have it:
          </h1>
          <p>
            I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in full
            stack<br></br> development (React.js & Node.js). I am very
            enthusiastic about bringing the<br></br> technical and visual
            aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel<br></br>
            perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code
            matters<br></br> to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've
            <br></br>continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
            challenges and<br></br> learning the latest technologies along the
            way. Now, in my early thirties, 7<br></br>
            years after starting my web development journey, I'm building
            cutting-edge<br></br> web applications using modern technologies
            such as Next.js, TypeScript,<br></br> Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase
            and much more.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products
            end to<br></br> end, from ideation all the way to development.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering
            around on<br></br> twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the
            journey of early startups or<br></br>
            enjoying some free time. You can follow me on Twitter where I share
            tech-<br></br>related bites and build in public, or you can follow
            me on GitHub.
          </p>
